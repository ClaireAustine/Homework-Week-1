# Homework-Week-1
I changed the div tags to proper semantics tags: header, nav, main, section, aside, and footer.

I then edited the CSS sheet to work properly with the html by changing the header and footer from being identified by class to being identified by their structural semantic tags.

Then I removed the class identifiers for header and footer from the html.

I added a media query to the end to fix an issue that happens on smaller windows and screens with the website.
